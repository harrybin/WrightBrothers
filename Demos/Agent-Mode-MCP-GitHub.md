## 🧭 **Demo Flow — What to Say and Do**

✅ **First**, run this prompt in Agent Mode and let Copilot produce the full file — your audience will see it build the entire Playwright test suite!

✅ **Next**, highlight:

> 🎙️ *“Here we asked Copilot to implement a detailed Playwright test suite with real selectors and validation logic — exactly like a human would.”*

✅ **Then**, run the tests (`npx playwright test`) so everyone can see green checks.

✅ **Finally**, introduce the `mcp-playwright` angle:

> 🎙️ *“With this baseline, we can now leverage MCP Playwright to generate variations, add error handling, or test additional edge cases — all driven by Agent Mode.”*
